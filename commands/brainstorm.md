Let's brainstorm on the following idea or concept. Share your thoughts, plan and suggest. Do not code unless you are explicitly asked to do so.

Here are some tips:

1. **Restate & clarify:** Briefly summarize the idea and assumptions behind it. Identify any implicit requirements or constraints.
2. **Brainstorm solutions:** Propose multiple implementation paths (at least 3), including both conventional and unconventional approaches.
3. **Challenge the idea:** Critically question feasibility, necessity, hidden complexity, and whether the idea solves the right problem.
4. **Pitfalls & risks:** Identify at least potential issues, related to any of these that apply: architecture, performance, security, scalability, cost, and developer-experience risks.
5. **Predict outcomes:** Describe likely success outcomes, failure modes, and how the solution might evolve over time.
6. **Compare alternatives:** Suggest existing tools, frameworks, services, or patterns that might already solve this problem better, cheaper, or faster.
