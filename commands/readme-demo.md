# readme-demo

You are generating a README.md for a **demo/learning repository**. This is NOT a library or production tool - it's an educational playground that developers can fork to explore and experiment with.

**Your first tasks:**

1. Identify the project name and topic from the repository structure, package.json, or existing documentation
2. Analyze the codebase to understand what patterns, features, or concepts are being demonstrated
3. Generate a README that helps users navigate and learn from this repository

---

## Analysis Phase

Before writing, examine the repository to discover:

### Project Identity

- [ ] Project name (from package.json, existing README, or folder name)
- [ ] Primary topic or theme of the demo
- [ ] Target audience (who would benefit from this demo?)

### Technical Stack

- [ ] Framework(s) used
- [ ] Styling approach (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
- [ ] UI component libraries
- [ ] Database/ORM if applicable
- [ ] Package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn)
- [ ] Any other significant dependencies

### Features & Patterns

- [ ] Study the folder structure to identify what concepts are being demonstrated
- [ ] Look for different implementations of similar features (often indicates pattern comparisons)
- [ ] Identify any performance demos, rendering strategy comparisons, or architectural patterns
- [ ] Note any API routes, server actions, or data fetching patterns

### Project Structure

- [ ] Map out the main directories and their purposes
- [ ] Identify where shared components live vs. page-specific components
- [ ] Note any configuration files, environment setup, or database schemas

## README Structure to Generate

### 1. Hero Section

- Project name with a brief, compelling tagline
- One paragraph explaining what this demo showcases
- Badges for key technologies or stack if relevant

### 2. What This Repo Demonstrates

- List the main features, patterns, or concepts users can explore
- Be specific about what makes this demo valuable for learning

**NOTE**: We want to keep this as minimal as possible, and not showcase the whole thing. We want to keep it focused on the features that are being demonstrated. Try to figure them out. If you can't, ask for help.

### 3. Tech Stack

- List all significant technologies with versions where relevant
- Brief notes on why each technology is used

### 4. Project Structure

- Provide a clear folder overview
- Explain the organization conventions used
- Help users know where to look for what

### 5. Getting Started

- Prerequisites (Node version, package manager, etc.)
- Installation steps
- Environment setup (if applicable)
- Running the development server
- Accessing the application

### 6. Exploration Guide

- Suggest a learning path through the demo
- Point users to the most interesting features first
- Recommend what to modify or experiment with
- Suggest using browser DevTools to observe behavior differences

### 7. Additional Sections (as applicable)

- Links to relevant documentation for technologies demonstrated
- Notes on contributing (typically "fork and experiment" for demos)
- Acknowledgments for libraries or inspirations

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Friendly, educational, inviting experimentation
- **Language**: Use words like "explore", "experiment", "try out", "fork and play"
- **Formatting**:
  - Use clear section headers with emojis where appropriate
  - Keep paragraphs concise but informative
  - Use tables for comparing different implementations
  - Include code blocks for terminal commands
- **Focus**: Help users understand what they're looking at and how to learn from it

---

## Output

Generate a complete, well-formatted README.md that welcomes developers who want to learn through hands-on exploration of this demo repository.
